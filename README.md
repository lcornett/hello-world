# hello-world
This is my first github repository and is a learning repository.
My background is QA. I have spent 20 years as software qa Analyst/Engineer. My current company pretty much did away with QA Analysts. All of the QA Analysts were converted to Software Engineers or QC Analysts. Being a QA Engineer, and because I like coding, I chose Software Engineer.
